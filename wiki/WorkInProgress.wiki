= It is still work in progress! =

Linux async I/O implementation is still work-in-progress and there's no perfect solution.

There are other solutions:

 * check out [http://lwn.net/Articles/172844/ Polyakov's work] (not developed anymore)
 * check out [http://www.bullopensource.org/posix/ POSIX aio for Linux]
 * check out [http://lwn.net/Articles/225714/ eventfd]
 * check out [http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/suparna/aio/ Suparna's patches]

I'm not sure if any of those works with vanilla kernel.

= It still can block! =

io_submit - the procedure called by Queue.schedule functions (Queue.scheduleRead, for example) can be blocking. 

When?

 * file is not opened with os.O_DIRECT flag
 * output data buffer is not page-aligned
 * you run out of block layer requests:
   {{{
You don't mention what hardware you are running this on (the disk sub
system). io_submit() will block, if you run out of block layer requests.
We have 128 of those by default, but if your io ends up getting chopped
into somewhat smaller bits than 1MiB each, then you end up having to
block on allocation of those. So lets say your /src is mounted on
/dev/sdaX, try:

# echo 512 > /sys/block/sda/queue/nr_requests
    }}}
